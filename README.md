# ChatGPTAudioIO

### Description
A terminal app that lets the user interact with the Chat GPT Api using either text or speech then recieve both textual and audible outputs.

### Purpose
I made this app because Chat GPT has become a big part of my learning process when it comes to multiple fields (not just programming). I have found this app to be useful when I find needing a quick answer to problems of medium or lower complexity since the model used in the API did not seem to be as powerful as the model accessible on the web but still sufficient and is particularly useful when I am in the middle of an activity.
